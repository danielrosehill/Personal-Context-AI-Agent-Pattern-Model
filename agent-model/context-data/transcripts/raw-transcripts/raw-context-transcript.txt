The purpose of this audio recording and voice note is to add to a repository where I want to demonstrate quickly a pattern for working with AI that I found really amazing. Everything that I do and record or document with AI will become very quickly outdated. Even the stuff I was working on last year that was "Oh, this is really cool and kind of frontier" already seems very old school. I expect that the pattern will continue into the future, but nevertheless, I think it's important to document and share workflows that are working now.

This is one that I've told some friends about and that I really believe has amazing potential for good in terms of using AI for something quite powerful, especially with the long-context models, which today is basically all of them. At least if you're using cloud AI tools, the context that you're going to throw at the models is not going to be a constraint in this workflow, realistically.

The type of workflow I've done—I'm not sure if I mentioned this is my take two of this voice note—I've used this for **career planning**, which is a pretty great use case. You can record context data about where you are in your career, where you want to be, and you can put in your resume. So that's a very nice pattern.

There's also **health problem resolution**. I've been struggling with a couple of really persistent health issues since having a surgery a few years ago. My wife actually encouraged me; she was like, "Why don't you try your AI stuff on this?" I was like, "All right, well, I'll start with context." That's the essential driving force in this workflow: it's all about gathering context data.

For that reason, that's basically why I began using voice tools. It wasn't just the maturity of speech-to-text. It was the fact that if I'm recording all the information I might want someone to know about my health problems, or about my job aspirations, or about my vacation preferences, it's a lot easier to just kind of hold up your mobile phone, which is exactly what I'm doing right now, than it is to type a long, meandering document. The document might be better structured, but you might never get around to doing it. I find with voice notes that it's just a fluid interface and it's kind of enjoyable, and you can do the text cleanup with AI. That's why it works for me personally.

This voice note will just be basically a model of real data, but I'm not going to go as in-depth as I would otherwise about all the nuance. I don't want to capture it because it's really just for a demo project rather than an actual real project. I will say that the pattern that I'm going to be modeling, and I'm going to put the audio file in the repo too, is going to be this:

1.  I start with my **audio recording**.
2.  From that, I do **speech-to-text**. It's kind of a lightweight cleanup process; it's not just pure speech-to-text transcription. I have a system prompt that says—and this works very, very well with Gemini because you can kill two birds with one stone—you can upload your audio file and say, "Transcribe this, but don't just transcribe this, do a little bit of cleanup to make the transcription a bit more organized."
3.  That's what I do, and then from that, I go to **context chunking**, which is basically taking that big transcript and saying, creating an agent config that I'm sure I have up there in one of my repos, which basically says, "Chunk this. This is a big transcript. Your task is to identify the context data in it, context data meaning data that might be useful in providing contextual data to other AI tools. Create a separate Markdown file for each context document."

Now, sometimes if you're working with tools like Custom GPTs, etc., they have these limits on how many. They tend to be presented to consumers as "knowledge," and they often have limits like 10. So I might say, if that's the target, I might add to that instruction like, "Create up to 10 context files." Otherwise, I'll leave that open-ended so that the model won't be inhibited by some arbitrary restriction.

4.  Then, I will create a system prompt saying, "You're helping the user with, in this case, planning vacations. To assist the accuracy and relevance of your suggestions, you should consider the context data." That's basically the pattern. How you provide that context data can be RAG at the most, but I'm just going to model here Markdown files because Markdown is a great starting point. You can ingest up-cert that into RAG or whatever front-end you're using, so it's a kind of a neutral starting point. That's why I think I and a lot of people would just use Markdown for all the repository information.

All right, so without further ado, let me get into the vacation context data planning.

The purpose of this voice note, and I'm just going to record from this point forward exactly as if I were recording a context data snippet for my actual AI projects. The purpose of this voice note is to provide context data for an AI tool which I will create for providing assistance with planning vacations. In this context snippet, I'm going to try to provide a bank of information about the type of vacations I enjoy, where I'd like to go, where I have been that I have enjoyed less, and it's going to be for my wife and I. I'll provide context about our situation, our budget, and all the rest of it.

My wife and I—I'm changing names here. This is just a note for the repository; I'm changing names just for the purpose of information security. Let's call my son David, and let's call my wife Sarah, just to have names.

If you ask me right now what my dream vacation would be, where I'd like to be—my name is Daniel—it would probably be sitting somewhere with a good beer tap, affordable beer, and a bit of sunshine. I'm in a quite simple frame of mind because of the exhaustion from the initial months of parenting, which we haven't really had a break from since our delightful son was born. My wife and I both live in Jerusalem, in Israel, which affects our choice of vacation destination always, but especially now with the geopolitical climate and some countries being particularly unreceptive to people from Israel. I don't want to divert into politics in this, which is basically a tech project, but it is definitely a major consideration that we want to choose. We don't want to end up somewhere that is very hostile to anyone from Israel, regardless of what their political beliefs may be about the current political situation.

Vacations I've enjoyed less: I feel like the last few times we've gone away, we haven't had great success. Most of my recent trips have been not really vacations so much as a few days tacked onto work conferences. I wasn't too keen on **Istanbul**, although right now I would say it's out on the political grounds, but I did like the side of the city across the river. I'm forgetting exactly what side that was, if that's old or new.

More general parameters about vacations: Growing up, my family took a lot of beach holidays. That was our default vacation mode, and I've never. Just sitting on the beach all day, I can't really do it. I don't really enjoy it. I definitely like that to be part of the vacation, but I don't want to just go somewhere just to lay on a beach for the whole time. I'm very open about having adult ADHD, and I think that plays into it a bit. I neither like very crammed city breaks where it's like you have a lot of sightseeing to do in a few days. I find that overwhelming. But then I find just the opposite of just doing nothing and being on a beach for X amount of time also not a fan of it.

One thing that I try to avoid on vacations is just going to tourist hotspots. I'm a big fan of language learning; I have been since I was a child, and I love to either try to use what I know about the language or pick up some words and chat with locals and just try to experience it. In Israel, where we live, we have a really high cost of living, and it's always nice to go somewhere that is a little bit more affordable, not necessarily the cheapest destination we can get to, but it's always nice to be somewhere where we feel that we can spend money on stuff like drinks and food with a bit less inhibition than we do where we live.

Remote working: For a lot of my career up to this point, I've done either remote jobs or hybrid jobs or leaned into remote working a bit. I have to say I don't really like the idea of remote working at all on vacation, because then it's not really a vacation. But it's always good to have decent connectivity in the country as a fallback just for periodic access and to do non-work-related stuff like downloading podcasts onto your phone or whatever.

**Good food:** We both, when we're traveling, keep something equivalent to kosher, but we don't look for actual kosher-certified supermarkets and food, like vegetarian food. If somewhere just had everything, let's say bacon on the menu, that would be a bit of an issue. But places with particularly strong vegan or vegetarian cuisines actually tend to work out really well. I'm obsessed with **Indian food**. I could eat it every day, all day, and that's definitely a part of the world that I'd like to visit.

My wife is an architect. We went to **Venice**, which is like her, you know, she loves it. That wasn't a work trip. Venice was super expensive, really, really expensive, and I don't know, it just didn't do it for me. It was a lot of hassle to get to, it was full of people posing for selfies and photographs, and the food was very seafood-oriented. I didn't really enjoy it as a place for those reasons, but I enjoyed just getting away for a bit. I wouldn't personally feel a desire to go back there. I can totally understand that my wife is an architect. We were there for, I think, the end of a Biennale. She wanted to see all the things, and I was going around with her. We did go on a day trip to the wine tasting, which was an amazing day. That was the best part of that trip, in the winemaking country, and we absolutely loved that. That was so much fun.

Elsewhere in Turkey, **Antalya** wasn't a great success. In the summer, we go to the **US** to visit my wife's parents, or we often do. The US is fine, although it's not a country that I feel a particular affinity to other than through my wife being from there. It's not somewhere that I go frequently, but I don't feel a particular. If I were planning my own vacations, I don't think there's nowhere in the US that I'd say I'd love to see. Maybe I've heard that Houston is really cool, and I'd love to see the West Coast one day, just to say I've been there and see it and check it out, like Los Angeles, but again, not really a burning priority. More from a work standpoint, there are lots of interesting AI companies based there.

**Where I would like to visit.** One of my serious aspirations in life is to see sloths, as in the furry animal. Sloth visiting is bound up in ethical complications, and I follow the work of the Sloth Conservation Foundation on the internet. They're on various channels, and they do an amazing job at highlighting the challenges to the species, what is required in an ethical encounter, and I've been in touch with their team. I would really love nothing more than to go to visit them and anywhere that they green stamp as, "This is an ethical encounter." Ethical means that you can't hold a sloth; that's not, that stresses them. But there are places where you can see them in their natural habitat from a reasonably close distance, and that would do it for me. I wouldn't enjoy being party to harming the animal, of course, in any way.

Besides sloths, I've just heard it's an amazing country and seems like somewhere. I've never been to **Latin America**, and I used to speak pretty decent Spanish, so that would be a fun trip to take.

I come back to really the things I enjoy, I would say. Me on vacation, coming back to the ADHD stuff: It takes me about a week. I tend to benefit from longer vacations because it often takes me a full week to disconnect and get into a rhythm. When I do, I kind of slot into this like, I'll do a few hours of work or projects in the morning. Then in the afternoon, I'll take the rest of the day off to do fun stuff. If we were in Costa Rica, it might be lunch at a fun place, doing some sightseeing, doing a nature hike. I love to get exercise through walking whenever I'm traveling, but also here. I'll avoid taking public transport anywhere that I could walk. Not to save money, but because I just love walking. I'll put on a podcast or music, and I'll just sort of get exercise that way rather than going to a gym.

I wouldn't say I'm a huge wine connoisseur, but lately I'm definitely getting into wine, and I've had some really fun experiences.

**Videography:** I have a YouTube channel, or I did have one that I haven't really updated in a while, but I love content creation, not because I'm trying to gain a following. I'll just naturally want to take photos of stuff, even if it's just putting them open source on Pexels or shooting some stock video, just memories, creating them. Audio, podcasting. Maybe that's a bit of a contradiction to manufactured influencer hotspots like Venice, but I can definitely spend a lot of time. One of the good things about content creation is it makes me a bit more adventurous about places I will go. When I had a YouTube channel here, I was definitely more proactive. There were places I went because I'm like, "Oh, that'll be really interesting to video," that I otherwise mightn't have gone to, and I met some cool people that way as well. So it's been pretty enriching.

**Really random places:** One of my favorite pursuits as a kid—this is how weird I am—I used to go. I don't know if there's a name for this, but when you go on Google Maps and you find really random places that you never heard of or that you're like, "What is that little island there?" I used to do this with a friend, and we'd find some pretty. So all the really obscure places. My brain's a bit slow this morning. There are a few really obscure islands. Just to give one random example, the Diomede Islands off Alaska, between Russia. **Svalbard** is absolutely somewhere I'd love to visit, right near the top of my list. Svalbard, the northernmost inhabited part of the world.

What else is there, though? As much as I say I'd love to visit India, I don't really want to get food poisoning, so somewhere with. That's too much. This may be turning into a laundry list of potential problems why I don't want to leave, but I got really bad food poisoning in Egypt once, and I'm not eager to repeat that experience.

My wife is more easygoing than me, that's why maybe we're a good couple, and she's really interested in **urban planning and architecture**, and I've sort of become interested in it through her. **Barcelona** was somewhere that she wanted to visit, I think for that reason. We went again after a conference. I wasn't mad about Barcelona. I don't know what it was, but it just didn't really do it for me. But some Italian cities I've been to: I went to **Bologna** once with my mom, and I thought that was just absolutely magical. I went to **Turin** in Italy for a conference, and I thought that was a really cool place. I actually end up enjoying mostly, when talking about travel experiences, places I just end up in and I'm like, "Oh, this is actually a really nice place. I'm really enjoying my time here," as opposed to these are the tourist hotspots.

Regarding then, regarding travel with our logistics cost, being based in Israel, at the moment, we have. I looked at the list of operators here before, and it's surprisingly diverse. They fly to some really interesting parts of the world, like Baku, for example, even Azerbaijan, places in Central Asia is the geographical region. I've always thought, "Oh, we should make more use of those routes to just explore." I had a really good experience traveling on **Wizz Air** before. Because I grew up in Ireland, I flew Ryanair so many times in my life. I always found it really miserable, and Wizz Air for some reason just kind of worked fine for us. We both thought it was really. Digital: I think that was a reason that Wizz Air was good. It was quite digitally oriented. If you used their app, you were good. In general, I like more tech-progressive societies and places, which brings me onto **Japan**.

Japan would probably be really near the top of my wish list, just because it's kind of weird. I've heard from a lot of people in a good way, and I'm certainly kind of eccentric, so there is a connection there. I'm really, I guess what appeals to me the most about traveling isn't seeing things or seeing places as much as meeting authentic local people and being exposed to new ways of living, new perspectives on life, and new ways of seeing the world. Which is why I think a lot of the places I have been to haven't really jived exactly.

In terms of Eastern cultures, I've been to none. I've been to none of the East. I had a very close friend who lived in **Hong Kong** for a number of years and became really interested in that part of the world, went out to **Taiwan**, the Chinese mainland. Truth be told, **Singapore**. If I had an unlimited budget, I'd want to go to every single one of these places to learn the East.

One more limitation to add to my list of limitations and woes: I have **asthma**, which I only thought to mention because I know in parts of China, the air pollution is really bad, and I've always thought that it probably wouldn't be on the cards to visit for that reason. Generally, it's well controlled, but I try not to do things like subject myself to. When there are wildfires here, I try to stay indoors more, so I'd say places with really uncontrolled air quality issues are probably places I'd avoid.

Finally, on the list of medication: I travel with meds, I haven't had any issues. The only medication I've been taking that does cause issues or can cause issues is **Vyvanse**, which is an ADHD medication, and as it's controlled, it's always on my mind that I need to know that it's legal. I think Japan's actually one of the few places with questionable restrictions around that. On Reddit, a lot of people say they had no trouble at all, but I want to be sure before I'd go to any of these places that it's. You know, I have a doctor's note, prescriptions, all the rest of it, but I don't want to accidentally wind up in some totalitarian state, whether through a layover or destination, that I wind up in prison because I traveled with a bottle of Vyvanse in my luggage.

So that's really open-ended, but try to pull out as much context data as you can from that information.
