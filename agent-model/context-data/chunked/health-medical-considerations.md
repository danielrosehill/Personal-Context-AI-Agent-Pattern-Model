# Health and Medical Considerations

## Medical Conditions

### Asthma
- **Generally well controlled**: Manages it effectively under normal conditions
- **Air quality sensitivity**: Tries to stay indoors during wildfires
- **Avoidance**: Would avoid places with really uncontrolled air quality issues
- **Specific concern**: Parts of China with bad air pollution probably not on the cards

### Adult ADHD
- **Openly shares**: Very open about having adult ADHD
- **Impact on preferences**: Affects vacation style - needs balance, not too packed or too passive
- **Decompression time**: Takes about a week to disconnect and get into rhythm
- **Benefits from longer vacations**: Due to the time needed to settle in

## Medications

### ADHD Medication (Vyvanse)
- **Currently taking**: Travels with this medication
- **Controlled substance**: Causes potential issues as it's a controlled medication
- **Legal concerns**: Always on his mind to verify legality in destination countries
- **Documentation**: Has doctor's note and prescriptions
- **Major concern**: Doesn't want to accidentally wind up in trouble (prison) in a totalitarian state
- **Trip planning impact**: Needs to verify medication is legal before visiting any destination
- **Specific concern**: Japan has questionable restrictions, though Reddit users report no trouble

### General Medication Travel
- **Experience**: Travels with meds generally without issues
- **Vyvanse is the exception**: Only medication that causes or can cause issues

## Past Health Issues While Traveling

### Food Poisoning
- **Egypt experience**: Got really bad food poisoning in Egypt once
- **Not eager to repeat**: This experience makes him cautious
- **Impact on India plans**: Creates hesitation about visiting India despite strong interest
