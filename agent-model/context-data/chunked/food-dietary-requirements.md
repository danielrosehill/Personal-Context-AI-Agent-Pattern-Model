# Food and Dietary Requirements

## Dietary Practices

Both Daniel and Sarah keep something equivalent to kosher when traveling, but don't require actual kosher-certified food.

### What Works

- **Vegetarian food**: Works perfectly for their dietary needs
- **Vegan cuisine**: Places with strong vegan or vegetarian cuisines tend to work out really well
- **Indian food**: Daniel is obsessed with Indian food and could eat it every day, all day

### What Doesn't Work

- **All meat/bacon menus**: If somewhere had everything as bacon on the menu, that would be an issue
- **Heavy seafood focus**: Venice's seafood-oriented food was challenging

## Food-Related Interests

- **Wine**: Daniel is getting more into wine lately and has had some really fun wine-related experiences
- **Not a huge connoisseur**: But definitely developing appreciation and interest
- **Wine tasting**: The wine tasting day trip during Venice visit was the best part of that trip
