# Work and Connectivity Preferences

## Remote Working on Vacation

### Philosophy
- **Against the concept**: "I don't really like the idea of remote working at all on vacation"
- **Reasoning**: "Then it's not really a vacation"
- **Career context**: Has done remote, hybrid jobs, and leaned into remote working throughout career

### Ideal Vacation Work Balance
- **Week to decompress**: Takes about a week to disconnect and get into rhythm
- **Morning routine when settled**: A few hours of personal work or projects in the morning
- **Afternoons off**: Takes the rest of the day off for fun activities
- **Examples of afternoon activities**: Lunch at fun places, sightseeing, nature hikes

## Connectivity Requirements

### Internet Access
- **Not for work**: Doesn't want connectivity for work purposes on vacation
- **Fallback purposes**: Good to have decent connectivity as a fallback
- **Non-work uses**:
  - Periodic access for personal reasons
  - Downloading podcasts
  - Other personal digital needs

### Tech-Progressive Preferences
- **General preference**: Likes more tech-progressive societies and places
- **Example - Wizz Air**: Appreciated that it was "quite digitally oriented" - if you used their app, you were good
- **Contrast with Ryanair**: Found Ryanair really miserable despite flying it many times growing up in Ireland
