# Vacation Preferences

## What Daniel Enjoys

Daniel's ideal vacation involves a balanced approach - not too packed with activities, but not purely passive either. His current simple dream is sitting somewhere with a good beer tap, affordable beer, and a bit of sunshine.

### Activity Balance

- **Dislikes pure beach holidays**: Growing up with beach holidays, Daniel finds just sitting on a beach all day unenjoyable and cannot do it
- **Dislikes overly crammed city breaks**: Finds overwhelming schedules with lots of sightseeing exhausting
- **Has adult ADHD**: This influences his need for balanced activity levels
- **Needs longer vacations**: Takes about a week to disconnect and get into a rhythm
- **Ideal vacation rhythm**: A few hours of personal projects/work in the morning, then afternoon free for fun activities like lunch, sightseeing, or nature hikes

### Authentic Experiences

- **Avoids tourist hotspots**: Prefers authentic local experiences
- **Language learning enthusiast**: Loves trying to use language knowledge or picking up words to chat with locals
- **Values meeting authentic local people**: More interested in being exposed to new ways of living and perspectives than just seeing sights
- **Content creation**: Has a YouTube channel (not updated recently) and enjoys photography, videography, and audio/podcasting - not for following but for memories and creative expression
- **Content creation benefit**: Makes him more adventurous about places he'll visit

### Physical Activity

- **Loves walking**: Will avoid public transport to walk instead, even if not to save money
- **Exercise through walking**: Puts on podcasts or music and walks for exercise rather than going to a gym
- **Enjoys nature hikes**: When traveling, likes incorporating nature walks
