# Dream Destinations and Places Daniel Wants to Visit

## Top Priority Destinations

### Costa Rica - Sloth Visiting
- **Primary motivation**: See sloths in their natural habitat
- **Ethical focus**: Follows Sloth Conservation Foundation work, wants only ethical encounters
- **Ethical means**: Can see them from reasonably close distance, but not hold them (stresses the animals)
- **Won't compromise**: Would not enjoy being party to harming the animal in any way
- **Also interested**: Heard it's an amazing country overall
- **Connection**: Used to speak pretty decent Spanish

### Svalbard
- **High priority**: "Absolutely somewhere I'd love to visit, right near the top of my list"
- **Appeal**: The northernmost inhabited part of the world
- **Interest type**: Obscure, remote location

### Japan
- **Very high priority**: "Really near the top of my wish list"
- **Appeal**: "Kind of weird in a good way" - Daniel identifies as eccentric
- **Interest**: Exposure to new ways of living and perspectives
- **Tech aspect**: Tech-progressive society
- **Consideration**: Need to verify ADHD medication (Vyvanse) legality - some questionable restrictions but Reddit users report no trouble

## Latin America (General)
- **Never been**: Would be first time in Latin America
- **Language**: Used to speak pretty decent Spanish, would be fun to use it

## Eastern Destinations

### General Interest
- **Has been to none**: Never visited any Eastern cultures
- **Strong curiosity**: Really interested in learning about the East
- **With unlimited budget**: "I'd want to go to every single one of these places to learn the East"

### Specific Eastern Locations
- **Hong Kong**: Had close friend who lived there for years, became interested
- **Taiwan**: Friend's experiences sparked interest
- **Chinese mainland**: Interest through friend
- **Singapore**: On the list if budget unlimited

## Central Asia
- **Azerbaijan/Baku**: Surprisingly accessible from Israel
- **General region**: Always thought "we should make more use of those routes to just explore"
- **Accessible**: Diverse flight operators from Israel to this region

## India
- **Strong interest**: "As much as I say I'd love to visit India"
- **Connection**: Obsessed with Indian food
- **Concern**: Doesn't want food poisoning (had really bad experience in Egypt once)

## Random/Obscure Places
- **Childhood hobby**: Used to explore Google Maps finding really obscure places
- **Examples**: Diomede Islands off Alaska (between Russia and Alaska)
- **Pattern**: Interested in weird, unusual, off-the-beaten-path locations
