# Budget and Cost Considerations

## Cost of Living Context

Daniel and Sarah live in Israel, which has a very high cost of living. They appreciate destinations that are more affordable than their home country.

## Budget Parameters

- **Not seeking cheapest destinations**: Don't need the absolute cheapest option
- **Value for money**: Want somewhere they can spend money on drinks and food with less inhibition than at home
- **Appreciate affordability**: Nice to feel they can be less restrictive with spending on daily pleasures

## Past Experiences with Cost

- **Venice was very expensive**: Found it "really, really expensive" and this negatively impacted the experience
- **Prefers accessible pricing**: Wants to enjoy local food and beverages without constant budget stress
